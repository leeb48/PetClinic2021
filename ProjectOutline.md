# Main Idea

> A pet clinic app that allows users to make appointments with veterinarians. The main page of the app will display all the upcoming appointments and they can be filtered by date. When veterinarians login, they will be able to see all their patients on a dashboard. They should be able to confirm, cancel, or reschedule their appointments. Same with pet owners. They will be able to see all their appointments with their veterinarians and make changes to them. On the appointment details page there should be a section where people can chat about the appointment. Also the pet owners should be able to book appointments based on available time slot. The duration of the appointment should be changeable from the veterinarian's side. There should be a page showing the daily schedule for all the veterinarians.
